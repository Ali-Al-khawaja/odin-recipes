    <h1>French Fried Potatoes</h1>
    <p>The best potatoes for French fries are soaked in a sugar solution before frying. The sugar solution has something to do with the carbohydrates and prevents the potatoes from soaking up a lot of grease, so they get crunchy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>â…“ cup white sugar</li>
